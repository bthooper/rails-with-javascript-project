# Rails with Javascript Project
## For Flatiron School
### Bryan Hooper

I created this project as part of the [Flatiron School](http://learn.co)
curriculum.  The goal of this project was to adopt my previous Ruby on
Rails project with AJAX features. 

#### Summary

The Ruby on Rails project that I am adopting is my ["Champion: A Playbook
Manger for Football
Coaches"](https://github.com/bthooper/Chamption-The-Football-Playbook-Manger)
project. That app was designed to allow a football coach to put together
a list of playbooks with plays in them and to set up a schedule against
a list of opponents.
